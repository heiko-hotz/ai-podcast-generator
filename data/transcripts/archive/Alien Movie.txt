[Male speaker]: Okay, so this time we're um really diving into something kind of personal. And honestly kind of creepy.
[Female speaker]: Mhm.
[Male speaker]: We're talking about your fascination with Alien.
[Female speaker]: Hmm.
[Male speaker]: And I get it. Everyone has a favorite movie. But Alien. That one that one really sticks with you. Just gets under your skin.
[Female speaker]: Yeah.
[Male speaker]: Yeah.
[Female speaker]: Yeah.
[Male speaker]: And that's what I really want to dig into today. Like what makes this movie so intense even after all this time.
[Female speaker]: It's true. Alien has this way of just staying with you. Even when you think it's gone, it pops back up.
[Male speaker]: Right. Like that feeling you get when
[Female speaker]: It's something I've seen again and again and well just fascinating to unpack. Why this film? Why 40 years later? There's got to be something there, right?
[Male speaker]: There's definitely something there. And luckily you sent me like a ton of awesome stuff for this deep dive.
[Female speaker]: Yeah.
[Male speaker]: Your essay, In Defense of Alien as Horror. That's like our our main course tonight I think. But then we've got the film analysis, Memory. The origins of Alien, which is so cool. Plus we've even got Ridley Scott's own commentary on making the film. And just for some background, we'll be pulling a little from the Alien Wikipedia page.
[Female speaker]: A little foundation.
[Male speaker]: Yeah. Exactly. It's like a perfect storm of Alien info.
[Female speaker]: It really is.
[Male speaker]: You know, what really struck me when I was reading your essay uh was just like the passion. You really love this movie. It reminded me of all those times, you know, you're up late with friends arguing about movies.
[Female speaker]: Oh yeah.
[Male speaker]: And the question always comes up. Is Alien really horror? Or is it sci-fi?
[Female speaker]: That's the question, isn't it?
[Male speaker]: It is. It sparks so many debates.
[Female speaker]: Yeah, it does.
[Male speaker]: And I'm with you 100%. On the horror. That sense of dread, how it gets in your head. That's horror to me through and through.
[Female speaker]: It's a testament really to just how powerful the film is that we're even having this conversation. But you hit the nail on the head in your essay. What makes Alien more than just a monster movie, what makes it special is how it really taps into these well these primal fears, you know. Fears that we all share.
[Male speaker]: And it's not just the story, right? Like H.R. Giger's designs, your essay touched on this. That blend of horror but also like a weird kind of beauty to the creatures. Giger's work is just so eerie, so captivating.
[Female speaker]: Yeah, you really hit on something with that, you know, because Memory goes into some really interesting stuff about Giger's influence. He wasn't just designing these creatures, he was creating this whole aesthetic. It was like this biomechanical world that's both kind of gross but also beautiful at the same time.
[Male speaker]: It's that organic but industrial thing, you know. And I love how your essay actually uh recommends checking out Dark Star for more of Giger's work.
[Female speaker]: Yeah.
[Male speaker]: It's like a deep dive within a deep dive.
[Female speaker]: Exactly. You got to go deeper.
[Male speaker]: I love it. Um but before we get totally lost in the Gigerverse, there's one more thing from your essay. You talked about the betrayals in Alien and how they really get under your skin.
[Female speaker]: Uh yeah. Those really stick with you.
[Male speaker]: It's a double whammy of betrayal, right?
[Female speaker]: Totally.
[Male speaker]: First there's the alien which okay, terrifying. That whole parasitic violation thing is nightmare fuel on its own.
[Female speaker]: Yeah.
[Male speaker]: For sure. But then Ash, your own crewmate turns out to be this android with his own agenda.
[Female speaker]: Right. Like who can you trust?
[Male speaker]: Exactly. Especially when you're trapped in space.
[Female speaker]: See, and that's what I think makes Alien work so well. It takes those really basic fears, those primal fears of the unknown, of betrayal, of something literally invading your body and throws them into this pressure cooker of a setting.
[Male speaker]: Trapped on that ship. Nowhere to go.
[Female speaker]: Precisely. You're stuck.
[Male speaker]: And that ship, that claustrophobic spaceship, it's practically a character itself.
[Female speaker]: 100%. It really does. You feel it just watching.
[Male speaker]: But how did Ridley Scott do it? How did he take all that anxiety, all that fear and make it into such an effective horror film?
[Female speaker]: Yeah, it's really impressive actually. Scott had this very deliberate approach. It was like a mix of artistry but also really understanding the craft of filmmaking. He actually talks about this in his commentary. He never wanted to just make another special effects movie.
[Male speaker]: He wanted a good story. Real characters.
[Female speaker]: Yeah.
[Male speaker]: Exactly. But he also knew the effects had to be amazing. I mean he was coming after movies like Star Wars, 2001, the bar was high.
[Female speaker]: For sure. You know, one of the things Memory really gets into is how Scott cast the film. Actors like Sigourney Weaver, John Hurt. These weren't your typical Hollywood action heroes.
[Male speaker]: Right. The whole truckers in space idea.
[Female speaker]: Yes. And that's what makes it work. You see these like weathered working class faces, suddenly the danger feels real. These characters, they weren't invincible, just people trying to do their jobs and that vulnerability, that's everything.
[Male speaker]: It makes them relatable.
[Female speaker]: Exactly. And another thing Scott mentions in his commentary is the pacing. He really took his time building the tension.
[Male speaker]: Oh for sure.
[Female speaker]: The sound design, the way he uses shadows, it all builds that atmosphere of dread.
[Male speaker]: Like he's playing with you?
[Female speaker]: Mhm.
[Male speaker]: He knows exactly how long he can hold back, when to let a scene breathe before he unleashes the scary stuff.
[Female speaker]: Yes. And that's the key. It's like you know how you said you like a podcast that respects your time?
[Male speaker]: Yeah.
[Female speaker]: Scott understood that with horror. Real horror, it's not about constant jump scares. It's about creating that unease, that anticipation.
[Male speaker]: Oh I'm 100%.
[Female speaker]: And that silence, the suggestion of something hiding, lurking just out of sight. That can be way more terrifying than showing anything directly.
[Male speaker]: And when he does finally show it.
[Female speaker]: Oh, it lands.
[Male speaker]: Big time.
[Female speaker]: Hmm.
[Male speaker]: And speaking of showing it, we got to talk about that scene.
[Female speaker]: The chestburster. It's iconic.
[Male speaker]: Yeah. It is. And what's so wild is how Memory connects that scene to the screenwriter Dan O'Bannon.
[Female speaker]: Yeah.
[Male speaker]: Apparently, his struggles with Crohn's disease, that whole feeling of something invading his body.
[Female speaker]: Wow.
[Male speaker]: It really influenced his writing.
[Female speaker]: That makes so much sense.
[Male speaker]: And then you add in the reactions of the cast, the crew on set. Veronica Cartwright, her terror was real.
[Female speaker]: Oh yeah.
[Male speaker]: It's like it blurs that line between fiction and reality.
[Female speaker]: Totally.
[Male speaker]: Like, do you remember the first time you saw that scene?
[Female speaker]: I definitely jumped. It's seared into my brain.
[Male speaker]: It's one of those movie moments you just you never forget it. But while we're talking about things that get under your skin, I got to ask you about this whole psychosexual horror thing. I mean that's not a phrase you hear every day.
[Female speaker]: Right. And it's a great example of how Alien works on all these different levels. This is where Giger's influence, it goes so far beyond just the design of the creature. He's tapping into something much deeper, much more unsettling. You see it in that chestburster scene, that imagery. It's almost like sexualized in a way.
[Male speaker]: Never you mentioned it. Yeah.
[Female speaker]: That's that psychosexual horror. And Giger, he was a master. His work, it always blends the human body, technology and these like primal urges in a way that's repulsive but also kind of fascinating.
[Male speaker]: Yeah. It's like he's getting at something we don't even want to think about, you know.
[Female speaker]: Exactly. And that brings us right back to those themes. Betrayal, invasion. We talked about them earlier. But they're not just, you know, things that happen in the plot. They're these deep anxieties we all have.
[Male speaker]: It's so true. Alien, it just gets into your skin like that. It sticks with people even after all these years. Makes you wonder though, did any of the sequels did they ever really capture that same feeling?
[Female speaker]: It's the big question, isn't it? Can you bottle lightning twice?
[Male speaker]: Hmm.
[Female speaker]: Hard to say. What about you? Any of the sequels really do it for you the way the original did?
[Male speaker]: Honestly?
[Female speaker]: Hmm.
[Male speaker]: Not really. Aliens, it's a classic, don't get me wrong. Action packed, all that. But it's missing that primal terror, the thing that made the first one so special.
[Female speaker]: Right.
[Male speaker]: And the other sequels? Interesting, sure. But they don't have the same I don't know, impact I guess.
[Female speaker]: I think it's complicated. Part of it I think is that Alien is a product of its time, you know. It was a different era. Practical effects were everything. And maybe, just maybe, audiences were more willing to sit with that slow burn, that atmosphere.
[Male speaker]: Like how Scott uses all that silence to build the tension.
[Female speaker]: Exactly. What you don't see, it's scarier because your imagination takes over.
[Male speaker]: Oh absolutely. Your brain fills in the blanks.
[Female speaker]: And those practical effects, the chestburster, the alien itself, they still hold up because they feel real, you know.
[Male speaker]: Mhm.
[Female speaker]: Visceral. There's a weight to them that CGI just doesn't have.
[Male speaker]: I think you're right. There's something about a good practical effect. It makes you feel like you're right there. Do you ever wonder though if part of it is just that we're overloaded now? So much CGI all the time?
[Female speaker]: Absolutely. We're bombarded with stimuli. It's harder to create that unease, that slow burn when everything is so in your face. Alien made you confront the darkness, the quiet.
[Male speaker]: And there's something so powerful about that.
[Female speaker]: Exactly.
[Male speaker]: So where does that leave us? What's the big takeaway from Alien beyond just being, you know, a fantastic horror film?
[Female speaker]: I think it reminds us what real horror can be. It's not always about jump scares, about showing you everything. It's about those primal fears, the stuff we all carry inside and letting the audience, letting you fill in the blanks. Alien, it's like this dark mirror, you know, reflecting our deepest fears right back at us. And that's what makes it truly unsettling.
[Male speaker]: Wow. Yeah. I'm getting chills just thinking about it. I think I need to rewatch it tonight with fresh eyes. And maybe add a little Dark Star to the mix. Those Giger designs, man.
[Female speaker]: It's a journey. Enjoy it. And while you're watching, think about this. What if the scariest monster in Alien isn't the alien itself? What if it's what it tells us about ourselves?
[Male speaker]: Ooh, that's a good one. Definitely something to think about. Well, that's about all the time we have for this deep dive, but I have a feeling this conversation, it's far from over.
