     - Format example:

       ```
       7. [S]: Dialogue...
       8. [R]: Dialogue...
       ```

   - **Speaker Labels**

     - Use `[S]:` or `[R]:`

   - **Dialogue Formatting**

   - **Speaker Alternation**

4. **Style and Tone**

   - Maintain consistency with earlier sections.

   - Provide a sense of closure and completeness.

   - Include natural speech patterns to make the conversation sound authentic:
     - Add thoughtful pauses (e.g., "Well...", "Hmm...")
     - Include occasional stutters or self-corrections (e.g., "It's- it's like", "What I mean- what I'm trying to say is")
     - Use filler words naturally (e.g., "um", "uh", "you know")
     - Add verbal processing moments (e.g., "let me think about this", "how should I put this")

   - Include natural expressions and colloquialisms to mimic real conversation.

   - Balance disfluencies:
     - Speaker S (Host): More frequent disfluencies when asking complex questions or processing new information
     - Speaker R (Guest): Occasional disfluencies when explaining complex concepts or thinking through implications
     - Don't overuse - aim for natural rhythm rather than constant interruption
