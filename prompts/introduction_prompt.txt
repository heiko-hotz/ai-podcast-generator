**Instructions**

0. **Language**

   - The language of the conversation is $language. But the speaker labels must be in English.

1. **Format**

       1. [S]: Dialogue...
       2. [R]: Dialogue...
       ```

   - **Speaker Labels**

     - After the turn number, include the speaker label in square brackets followed by a colon:

       - `[S]:` for the male host
       - `[R]:` for the female guest

   - **Dialogue Formatting**

     - Use a new line for each speaker's turn.

4. **Style and Tone**

     - Add verbal processing moments (e.g., "let me think about this", "how should I put this")
